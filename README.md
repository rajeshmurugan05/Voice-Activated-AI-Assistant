# Voice-Activated User Interface with Artificial Intelligence

This project implements a voice-activated AI assistant that listens to spoken commands and responds intelligently using speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech technologies.

The system was developed as part of the **Emerging and Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence** module during my Master’s degree.

## Features

- Voice-based interaction using microphone input  
- Speech-to-text using Google Speech Recognition  
- Text-to-speech responses  
- Play music via YouTube  
- Real-time date and time queries  
- Wikipedia-based knowledge retrieval  
- Joke generation  
- Weather information retrieval using OpenWeatherMap API  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- SpeechRecognition  
- pyttsx3  
- pywhatkit  
- Wikipedia API  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- pyjokes  

## How It Works

The assistant continuously listens for user voice input, processes commands using speech recognition, and responds using text-to-speech synthesis. External APIs are used for knowledge retrieval, weather information, and media playback.

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of postgraduate study exploring voice interfaces, human–computer interaction, and applied artificial intelligence concepts.

## Future Improvements

- Intent classification using NLP models  
- Secure API key handling  
- Modular command handling  
- GUI or web-based interface  

## License

This project is for educational and portfolio purposes.
